    "Poznaliśmy już przeszukiwanie po ustalonej siatce parametrów - `GridSearchCV`. Metoda ta ma jednak dwie dość istotne wady:\n",
    "* rozmiar siatki bardzo szybko rośnie wraz z ilością parametrów. Już dla czterech parametrów, po 5 wartości każdy, dostajemy $5^4 = 625$ kombinacji. W sytuacji, kiedy model uczy nam się minutę (a to w praktyce bardzo optymisyczny przypadek) musimy czekać 10 godzin na przejście pętli.\n",
